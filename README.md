Spring Playground - The Plan
-
The Plan is to have them all in the same project just to see how they work together. If we create a project to demonstrate each of them then we won't know if they work and how they work together.

DONE:
 - AOP example
 - CRUD example
 - REST example
 - Hibernate example
 - DI example
 - Multiple Data Sources (**WIP**: on the multi_db_v1 branch)
 - Spring Cache example (with EHCache3)

TODO:
 - multiple DBs in a proper way not as it is now on the multi_db_v1 branch (maybe use multiple spring maven modules?)
 - security example
 - mvc example with templates
 - REST services docs. built in or swagger.io
 - angular example
 - mongoDB example
 - elasticsearch example
 - consul config
 - consul discovery
 - cloud tracing with zpikin and sleuth
 - batch and schedule example
 - mail example

 - kafka microservices message bus (stream kafka)
