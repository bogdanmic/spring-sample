Spring Playground - The Plan
-
The Plan is to have them all in the same project just to see how they work together. If we create a project to demonstrate each of them then we won't know if they work and how they work together.

DONE:
 - AOP example
 - CRUD example
 - REST example
 - Hibernate example
 - DI example
 - Multiple Data Sources (**WIP**: on the multi_db_v1 branch)
 - Spring Cache example (with EHCache3)
 - MVC with Thymeleaf example (Thymeleaf reverse routing included)
 - Custom Application event example
 - Send Email example (as text or as Thymeleaf template)
 - Schedule and Batch Job examples

TODO:
 - multiple DBs in a proper way not as it is now on the multi_db_v1 branch (maybe use multiple spring maven modules?)
 - security example
 - multiple config files instead of a huge one.
 - REST services docs. built in or swagger.io
 - angular example
 - mongoDB example
 - elasticsearch example
 - consul config
 - consul discovery
 - cloud tracing with zpikin and sleuth
 - spring integration example. communicate between REST services. etc
 - kafka microservices message bus (stream kafka)
 - akka actor example
 - deploy it as a docker image
 - config profiles
